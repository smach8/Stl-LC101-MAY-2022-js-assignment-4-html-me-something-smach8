            These are stories of my dogs. They are the most loved, spoiled, and happy dogs I've ever seen. All three of them are comforting and protective. I wouldn't trade them for the world.

      <h2>Briar</h2>

         We brought home Briar at 8 weeks old. She was our first dog together as a couple. Briar was an absolute menace when she was a puppy. Luckily, at almost 6 years old, she has calmed down now. She likes long walks and barking at strangers until they say "hello" to her.

      <h2> Bonnie </h2>

         Bonnie goes by many names. Miss Bon, Bonnaroo, Trash Man and she answers to all of them. A friend of mine found bonnie in the dumpster area of a QT. She was wet, smelly, nails were really overgrown. Caitlyn brought her home, cleaned her up and found her a home with us. She is estimated to be around 9 or 10, however this doesn't her from playing with the other dogs. She got her name from a documentary that caitlyn was watching. Her favorite things are sleeping all day and begging for food.

      <h2> Miska</h2>

         Miska, well Miska is a whole demon. She is a 2 year old monster disguised as a husky. However, we love her very much. Miska came in to our lives' because my stepmom thought she was getting a cute little husky and instead was given miska. So, we brought her home for Christmas. While we love her very much, she uses her cleverness against us. Her favorite things are finding new ways to run out the door to be chased three miles and screaming at me.
